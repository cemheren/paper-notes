#Harnessing Deep Neural Networks with Logic Rules 

Interesting read with ideas around how to integrate rules with simple (CNN, LSTM) neural network architectures.

They use simple sentiment analysis technique (Kim 2014) and improve it with rules. 

Their end results aren’t as good as some of the complex models. And the generalization of the proposed solution isn’t well justified. 
However this can be interesting to consider for generative networks such as an LSTM that generates small C programs, where the C syntax rules are embedded as logic rules.
 
Todo: Link any open source implementation of this work.
